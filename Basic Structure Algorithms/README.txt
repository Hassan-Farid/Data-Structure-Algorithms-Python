Basic Structure Algorithms:
This section covers up basic structures of programming i.e. the control statements. Their usage in algorithm pseudocode
and their implementation in Python language. It comprises of three parts:

1. Sequence Statements:
	These algorithms and implementation coverup basic sequential statements such as displaying output, reading input,
assigning values and performing operations.

2. Decision Statements:
	These algorithms and implementations coverup the conditional statements i.e. single conditional, double conditional
and multiple conditional.

3. Iteration Statements:
	These algorithms and implementations coverup the repetition statements i.e. repeatedly performing a task using
either a for loop or while loop.

Instead of general description, an example has been used to explain the structuring of these statements during design of
algorithms and their implementation in python language.
