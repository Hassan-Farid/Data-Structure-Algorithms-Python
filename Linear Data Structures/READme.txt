Linear Data Structures:
This part contains various basic operational algorithms on linear data structures such as arrays, linked lists, etc.

1. Arrays:
	The Arrays portion comprises of algorithms on two types of arrays i.e. 1D(linear) and 2D(matrices)

a. Linear Arrays:
	The Linear Arrays cover the basic six types of operations: Sorting, Searching, Traversing, Insertion,
Deletion and Merging.
