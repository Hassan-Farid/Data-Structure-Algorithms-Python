Selection_sort(Array[], int N):

	START
Step 01: [Reading input]
	Read Array[]
Step 02: [Performing Selection Sort Procedure]
	Repeat FOR I := 1 TO N BY 1 DO:
		[a. Setting pointer for item to be compared]
		SET K := I
		[b. Comparing item with every other element of the array]
		Repeat FOR J := K+1 TO N BY 1 DO:
			[c. If some other element greater than item, than update pointer value]
			IF A[K] > A[J] THEN:
				SET K := J
			END IF
		[d. If pointer value not as same as before, swap elements]

			SET TEMP := A[K]
			SET A[K] := A[I]
